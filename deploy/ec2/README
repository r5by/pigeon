This script automates the deployment of a Pigeon cluster on ec2. To use it:

1) Get an ec2 account.

2) Get your access key ID and value from ec2. You need to have these available
   in environment variables AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
   respectively.

3) Generate a key-pair in the AWS control panel in the "US East" datacenter.

4) Run ./ec2_exp.sh --help to see how the script works.

   The basic workflow would is usually like this.
   # Launch instances
   # full name to .pem key file needs to be passed in
   # Following command will launch a cluster named "Pigeon",  create 2 backends and 1 frontend with m4.large instance type on EC2
   # NOTE: VPC AMI chosen needs to support m4 series instances
   ./ec2-exp.sh launch pigeon -k exprkey -i /Users/mac/.ssh/exprkey.pem -b 4 -f 1 -t m4.large -a ami-7c9a0115

   # Deploy Pigeon files, waiting 100 seconds for instances to boot before
   # attempting to contact them.
   ./ec2-exp.sh deploy pigeon -i /Users/mac/.ssh/exprkey.pem -l YH2.tr --cpus 1 -m 2 --trace-cut-off 10000.00

   # Start Pigeon daemons on each node
   ./ec2-exp.sh start-pigeon pigeon -i /Users/mac/.ssh/exprkey.pem -m 2

   # Start proto application (reading trace files)
   ./ec2-exp.sh start-proto pigeon -i /Users/mac/.ssh/exprkey.pem -m 2 -p 0.5


    # Collect logs to local directories for later analytics
  ./ec2-exp.sh collect-logs pigeon -i /Users/mac/.ssh/exprkey.pem -d <local_dir_for_logs>

   # Stop proto application
   ./ec2-exp.sh stop-proto pigeon -i /Users/mac/.ssh/exprkey.pem

   # Stop Pigeon
   ./ec2-exp.sh stop-pigeon pigeon -i /Users/mac/.ssh/exprkey.pem

   # Shut down the cluster (terminate)
   ./ec2-exp.sh terminate pigeon -i /Users/mac/.ssh/exprkey.pem
